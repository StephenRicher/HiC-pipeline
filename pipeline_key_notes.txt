# Generate rulegraph
snakemake --rulegraph | dot | display

Have the hapcompass output as None in config.
If not None: start allele specific pipeline
  - Generate cell type specific bowtie2 indexes
  - Save output to allele sub folder (directly append path to workdir?)
  - Don't run hapcompass pipeline
If None:
  - Generate normal bowtie2 index
  - Don't run snpsplit


If you had an additional binsize to the analysis after a run through
make sure you run snakemake -R juicerPre to regenerate the .hic files with the
new bin incorporated

# TO DO

# Need to rerun HiCcompare on cluster when internet is back online (now environment has tidyr)
